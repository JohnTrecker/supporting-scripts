allow a slackerfile to take a list of files to send

fix bug in get_current_commands_info

check command to print commands description (once get_current_commands_info is fixed) [currently running slacker with no args yields options, or using the -o or -a flags]

allow command to print long commands description (including the message and files to send)

`slacker set-class` to set the class
